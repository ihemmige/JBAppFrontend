# JBAppFrontend
Frontend for JBApp (job board app). This is a React UI that interfaces with the flask server deployed at https://jbappbackend.azurewebsites.net.

This app is currently deployed at https://jb-app-frontend.vercel.app/.

More info about deployed backend Flask server: https://github.com/ihemmige/JBAppBackend

To run locally:
1. Navigate into the root directory and then into the 'frontend' directory. 
2. Install the dependencies with 'npm install'. 
3. Then, the app should run with command 'npm start' on localhost:3000.
4. However, for the app to actually work with all functionality, the backend server must also be running locally. See JBAppBackend github link above.
